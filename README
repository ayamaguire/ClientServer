Client-Server Python Assignment, this time with python knowledge!

Hello, and welcome aboard the USS TROGDOR. I am your captain --

hang on, let me try again...


This is a client server application! It is written in Python 2.7, using Flask!
Beginning in a virtual environment or a clean Ubuntu 14.04 client, please run:
sudo pip install -upgrade requirements.txt

Or if you feel like making things harder for yourself, you can manually install Flask, requirements, and psutil.

Then, to start the server, run:
python FlaskServer.py

To start the clients, run:
python requester.py

You can manage various settings in the configuration json files.

Some info:
- The server is a simple Flask server. By default it launches on port 5000. If you change the setting
    in the server file, change it in the clients file too.
- The server uses threads to manage stuff; the client uses processes.
- If you'd explained to me what the difference between threads and processes was when I first got here,
    I would have almost understood it.
- Everything is sent to the server via a request. Hearbeats, data, etc.
- Processes are monitored using psutil.


Things I didn't do or don't understand:
p.join() on my processes appeared to halt the running of the other processes. Not what I want at all.
Since they ended on their own, I didn't worry about it too much.
