Client-Server Python Assignment, this time with python knowledge!

Hello, and welcome aboard the USS TROGDOR. I am your captain --

hang on, let me try again...


This is a client server application! It is written in Python 2.7, using Flask!
Beginning in a virtual environment or a clean Ubuntu 14.04 client, please run:
sudo pip install -upgrade requirements.txt

Or if you feel like making things harder for yourself, you can manually install Flask, requirements, and psutil.

Then, to start the server, run:
python FlaskServer.py

To start the clients, run:
python requester.py

I'll tell you a secret: I named them that so I wouldn't accidentally tab-complete-delete them when removing logfiles.

You can manage various settings in the configuration json files.
When I started at SolidFire, I didn't know json was. I was all, "Who's Jason?" (Thanks, Ryan!)

Some info:
- The server is a simple Flask server. By default it launches on port 5000. If you change the setting
    in the server file, change it in the clients file too.
- The server uses threads to manage stuff; the client uses processes.
- If you'd explained to me what the difference between threads and processes was when I first got here,
    I would have almost understood it.
- Everything is sent to the server via a request. Hearbeats, data, etc.
- Processes are monitored using psutil.
